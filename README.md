## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com) - Library
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info) - CSS architecture


### What I learned

In this particular challenge i've started using react and the very first problem was learning form validation, and for this i used the react hook form library, which made everything more simple, leting only some details to fix. 
Tryied really hard to make all the responsiveness look clean fine, and i think the final product ended up pretty ok. 
I've also tryied to started implementing a CSS architecture (BEM), but since this challenge didn't had such complexity, the pratice wasn't the best, but it was still a experience.

### Continued development

Looking foward to master the form validation using that library and improve my projects, seemed like that library has a lot more to offer.
